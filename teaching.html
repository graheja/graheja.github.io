												<dt>Teaching Development Program  - Advanced Track</dt>
												<dt style="color: grey"><i>Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning (2022-2025)</i></dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning’s Teaching Development Program offers doctoral students a path for sustained teaching development. Graduate students develop skills in describing and implementing pedagogical practices that draw on evidence-based educational research, developing learning goals and aligned assessment strategies that are clear and measurable, receiving and applying peer-to-peer feedback on teaching practice, and articulating a student-centered approach to teaching. As part of the Advanced Track, I developed a “Teaching as Research” proposal outlining the scientific investigation of guest lectures as pedagogical practice.</p>

												<dt>Senior Lead Teaching Fellow</dt>
												<dt style="color: grey"><i>Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning (2023-2024, 2024-2025)</i></dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The Senior Lead Teaching Fellows are chosen from exceptional Lead Teaching Fellows at Columbia. As the Senior Lead Teaching Fellow, I have developed pedagogical workshops, including a Learning Community at the American Museum of Natural History for 20 graduate student instructors to develop methods for teaching beyond the classroom. I also mentored 5-6 Lead Teaching Fellows each year on developing pedagogical methods that centered diversity, equity and inclusion. </p>

												<dt>Lead Teaching Fellow</dt>
												<dt style="color: grey"><i>Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning (2022-2023)</i></dt>


												<dd>
													<p>The Lead Teaching Fellowship is a selective teaching professional opportunity for doctoral students at Columbia. As the Lead Teaching Fellow, I’ve organized monthly Learning Lunches where 10 students chat with established Professors about pedagogy, inclusive teaching, and academia. I also hosted a <em> Would’ve Could’ve Should’ve </em>  Teaching Workshop, where doctoral students worked together to develop lesson plans, integrate feedback using a 4-pronged rubric focused on accessibility, inclusivity, and antiracial course design, and then re-teach lessons.  I mentor doctoral students in completing the prestigious Teaching Development Program certification, which is noted on the diplomas of high-achieving teachers at Columbia. </p>
