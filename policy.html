												<dt>BAAQMD Advisory Council</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The Bay Area Air Quality Management District is a public agency regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the nine counties of the San Francisco Bay Area. Established in 1955, it was the first regional air pollution control agency in the nation, and today BAAQMD leads in data, policy and implementation. The Advisory Council advises and consults with the Board of Directors and the Executive Officer on technical and policy matters. The Council also exercises its own initiative in selecting areas for exploration and study. View <a href="https://www.baaqmd.gov/about-the-air-district/advisory-council/agendasreports">agendas, meetings, and minutes</a>. In December 2023, I was appointed to my second term on the Advisory Council.

Since our founding in 2006, BEACN has worked with non-profits, startups, public organizations, and Fortune 500 companies to develop environmentally impactful and socially responsible business solutions. The scope of our services is diverse, but its foundation is built on the triple bottom line—prioritizing people, planet, and profit, in that order—to ensure a sustainable future for all. As President 2017-2018, I led BEACN's growth in expanding to 10 projects with 50+ members from various undergraduate and law programs across UC Berkeley.</p>

												<dt>White House Council on Environmental Quality</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) within the Executive Office of the President coordinates the federal government’s efforts to improve, preserve, and protect America’s public health and environment. CEQ, which was created in 1969 by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), advises the President and develops policies on climate change, environmental justice, federal sustainability, public lands, oceans, and wildlife conservation, among other areas. As the agency responsible for implementing NEPA, CEQ also works to ensure that environmental reviews for infrastructure projects and federal actions are thorough, efficient, and reflect the input of the public and local communities. Within CEQ, I worked on the Chief Sustainability Officer's Carbon-Free Electricity Team, where I: </p>
													<ul>
														<li>Led the development of a tool for aggregating and analyzing data from the Federal Government’s 52 Terawatt portfolio across 31 agencies and 890 utilities, and strategy with the White House, Department of Defense, General Services Administration and Federal Energy Management Program</li>
														<li>Also led the development of a CFE pricing tool which integrates brown power market costs, green power tariffs, social cost of carbon estimates, and grid mix projections into annual electricity procurement budgeting and sustainability planning.</li>
														<li>Prepared draft speech talking points for the White House Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Mayock</li>
														<li>Presented updates at weekly meetings to CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory</li>
														<li>and organized dialogues at the White House between top-level utility executives, government leaders, private-sector partners and community advocates.</li>

												<dt>South Asians for Black Lives</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>In 2019, a group of friends and I started <a href="https://www.malikah.org/south-asians-for-black-lives#:~:text=MISSION%20AND%20VISION,South%20Asian%20and%20Black%20communities.">South Asians for Black Lives</a>. The program aims to dismantle anti-Blackness and Indophobia and calls on our communities to join the racial solidarity movement. Through our social media, monthly newsletters, workshops/events, we focus on education and awareness as an enabler to inspire change. Oppressive systems like white supremacy, colorism, racism, and xenophobia work together to harm people of color, including South Asians. Our work is framed intentionally to tackle the complexities of anti-Blackness in South Asian communities, hold space for healing, and to activate South Asians to actively dismantle anti-Blackness. Our work has been featured in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/style/instagram-activism-graphics-zines.html">the New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/22/1004312/asian-americans-are-using-slack-groups-to-explain-racism-to-their-parents/">MIT Technology Review</a>. I led a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CF-3TlNJgic/">Cook-In</a> with Former Bon  Appetit Chef Sohla El-Waylly and Council on American-Islamic Relations Executive Director Zahra Billoo, which got over 194,000 viewers. </p>
