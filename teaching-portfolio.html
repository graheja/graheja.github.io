												<dd>
													<p>The Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning’s Teaching Development Program offers doctoral students a path for sustained teaching development. Graduate students develop skills in describing and implementing pedagogical practices that draw on evidence-based educational research, developing learning goals and aligned assessment strategies that are clear and measurable, receiving and applying peer-to-peer feedback on teaching practice, and articulating a student-centered approach to teaching. As part of the Advanced Track, I developed a “Teaching as Research” proposal outlining the scientific investigation of guest lectures as pedagogical practice.</p>

													<p>The Senior Lead Teaching Fellows are chosen from exceptional Lead Teaching Fellows at Columbia. As the Senior Lead Teaching Fellow, I have developed pedagogical workshops, including a Learning Community at the American Museum of Natural History for 20 graduate student instructors to develop methods for teaching beyond the classroom. I also mentored 5-6 Lead Teaching Fellows each year on developing pedagogical methods that centered diversity, equity and inclusion. </p>

													<p>The Lead Teaching Fellowship is a selective teaching professional opportunity for doctoral students at Columbia. As the Lead Teaching Fellow, I’ve organized monthly Learning Lunches where 10 students chat with established Professors about pedagogy, inclusive teaching, and academia. I also hosted a <em> Would’ve Could’ve Should’ve </em>  Teaching Workshop, where doctoral students worked together to develop lesson plans, integrate feedback using a 4-pronged rubric focused on accessibility, inclusivity, and antiracial course design, and then re-teach lessons.  I mentor doctoral students in completing the prestigious Teaching Development Program certification, which is noted on the diplomas of high-achieving teachers at Columbia. </p>

																<li><em>My favorite thing about the ice breakers was that we had a space to share out our opinion and our thoughts, specially since in my school I feel like we don't have the space for that.</em></li>
																<li><em>I enjoy this lesson and watching the video specially since some of us watch different videos so we had different answers and opinions on the questions.</em></li>
																<li><em>My favorite memory was going over what was redlining because I took a class in the summer about this and I kind of forgot everything and learning more about it made me remember.</em></li>
																<li><em>I learned more about how contaminated my community and the 5 boroughs are contaminated and how to prove it.</em></li>
																<li><em>I like that we had the opportunity to visit the website and learn more about the air quality. It was interesting seeing what the other students found out about the air quality in different parts of the world.</em></li>
																<li><em>I really liked talking about this, it was very interesting and I was surprised at how students at Columbia took initiative.</em></li>
																<li><em>My favorite memory was learning more about what was happening at Columbia University and I remember being surprised about what was going on.</em></li>
																<li><em>I really enjoy having time to work on our project in class especially since for me sometimes it can be hard to work on something because it's hard keeping up with all the homework.</em></li>
																<li><em>Talking about Derek Chauvin's trial was a moment where we all realized that the verdict might either resolve things or make things worse.</em></li>
																<li><em>Speaking with my peers was one of the funnest things because we all had different ideas.</em></li>
																<li><em>I was able to connect with my peers because they go to the same school as me and we knew each other which made it easier to connect with them and it was good talking to them about something else that wasn't related to school.</em></li>
																<li><em>[The instructor] asked a lot of questions and always checked up on us.</em></li>
																<li><em>I feel like I was able to connect with my instructor since Garima was always interested in how we were feeling and asking questions about how school was going gave her an insight into what was happening, which is something I feel connected the students with her.</em></li>

                                                <p>“HENRY’S LAW!!” screamed an entire classroom when I clicked on a video shared in our department's Slack channel. This was one of my proudest moments as an educator. As a Columbia Lead Teaching Fellow, I led a workshop for teaching assistants about using engaged learning in diverse classrooms, and demonstrated a technique using the Fishbowl game for pedagogy using all five senses. Many teaching assistants saw so much value that they brought the technique to their own classrooms. Now, in a room far from me, a technique I had developed was the reason that a humanities student from a marginalized background understood a climate concept well enough to act it out in front of a room full of graduate STEM scholars. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    My approach to teaching has developed in tandem with my research, and through it, I reaffirm my commitment to <strong> diversity, equity and inclusion. </strong> Teaching is fundamental to my theory of change. Over the past eight years, I have gone above and beyond my mandatory requirements and actively sought out teaching and pedagogy development activities at the University level as well as in a multitude of non-academic settings, ranging from teaching undergraduates in the humanities to highly technical PhD students across universities to professionals in the Global South with varied training backgrounds and native languages to training elementary school teachers in Oakland. I am flexible and adaptive to these different teaching environments, and across these diverse teaching contexts, I aim to always focus on inquiry-based learning. My ultimate goal as an instructor is to educate and inspire the next generation of leaders in the field.
                                                </p>  

                                                <p>
                                                    <strong> <u> I train students to become informed, independent thinkers. </u></strong> First, I believe in empowering students with tools and resources to develop their own critical thinking about all the tools available such as coding, ChatGPT, physical libraries, etc and their uses and drawbacks. Additionally, I teach through a variety of inquiry-centered techniques such as <strong> project-based learning </strong> and <strong> field trips </strong>. As a Teaching Assistant for Research Computing in the Earth Sciences, I mentored 15 graduate students in developing original research project ideas, and conducting inquiries using the computational tools taught in class. Providing individualized support for inquiry-based learning can often be challenging for instructors, which I address by fine-tuning a “show not tell” style for my office hours. Students mention that they <em> “went to [my] office hours religiously”</em> and that I <em> “was always super helpful in office hours and completely willing and excited to answer questions on the course material and on homework's/labs. [I] guided [students] through questions and made sure that everyone in office hours understood the material, which was very appreciated.” </em> My commitment to this extends beyond just the students in my classroom. As a Senior Lead Teaching Fellow at the Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning, I expanded my reach of this foundation of my work by developing and leading workshops on “Teaching Outside the Classroom” in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, for which I received a Diversity Initiative Award. Additionally, at the MINESCAPES Summer School in Germany earlier this year, I taught science and history graduate students how to use “citizen science” toolkits to monitor lead. Beyond teaching this group, I am also leading the writing of a collaborative manuscript on these field research pedagogy methods for the <em> Journal of Chemical Education </em>, to share knowledge on lessons and lead the discussion on inquiry-based learning among education professionals around the world. 
                                                </p>  
                                                        
                                                    
                                                <p>   
                                                    <strong> <u>My pedagogy is focused on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility.</u></strong>  As a Teaching Assistant for Climate Systems in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at Columbia, I updated legacy lectures to center modern discussions about environmental justice in climate science, and gender inequality in fieldwork. I also created classroom experiences that mixed traditional lectures, hands-on laboratory and varied homework formats to support diverse learning styles. I believe in creating research opportunities for students who have achieved concept mastery, while also engaging students who may be struggling by offering individualized support plans. One student review highlighted, “Garima was great, she let me resubmit an assignment after I booked office hours with her to discuss my low score.” My DEIA approach comes from my background in teaching K12, undergraduate, graduate and even professional levels, identifying gaps created at each of those levels and creating learning opportunities to address those gaps in my students’ education. 
                                                </p>
